## Introduction

Brain tumor detection is a critical area of medical imaging research aimed at enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. This project integrates various advanced methodologies to improve the precision and reliability of identifying tumor regions within brain images, thereby empowering clinicians with early and accurate diagnostic insights.

## Methodologies

### Fuzzy Clustering
Fuzzy clustering is used to segment complex brain tissue structures by assigning pixels a membership value representing their likelihood of belonging to multiple clusters. This probabilistic approach helps in accurately delineating tumor boundaries where tissue overlaps or is ambiguous.

### Texture Segmentation
Texture segmentation analyzes patterns and variations in pixel intensities to differentiate between different tissue types. By capturing intricate textural features, this method enhances the segmentation accuracy and specificity of tumor regions within brain images.

### Watershed Algorithm
The watershed algorithm is employed to refine segmentation by simulating a flooding process that delineates boundaries between distinct regions. In this project, it is particularly useful for pinpointing the exact location of blood leakage or other abnormalities within the brain.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM with semi-supervised clustering leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification accuracy. This approach is essential for distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor regions, especially when labeled data is limited.
